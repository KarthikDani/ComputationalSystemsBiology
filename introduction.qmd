-   Reverse engineering is the key aspect of systems biology

-   Computational biology is the leader in telling us what experiments do

-   Highlights gaps in knowledgeHelps in assisting experimentation

-   Inexpensive, Generalisable, allows for Prediction

-   Paper recommendation - can a biologist fix a radio

> Good models answers questions that are very difficult to answer in wet lab

## What is a Model?

> A model is an abstract, simplified, construct related to a part of reality and created for a particular purpose.

Model Divides world into 3 sets:

-   Whose effects are neglected

-   Whose effects are not considered even though it affects the model

-   Things the model is designed to study the behavior of

> How do we model is completely dictated by Why do we want to model

## Why Model/Simulate?

-   Approximate the parts of reality in order to predict

-   Create a simplistic representation of a date

-   Understand something - Large (eg: Road network \[easy to predict, linearity, more number of nodes\]) **vs** Complex (Metabolic pathway \[More edges, difficult to predict, Non linearity\])

-   What if? - To Highlight gaps in knowledge

> Start with bunch of hypothesis → build a model → Test against the reality → Find certain gaps, repeat (lot of efforts in modeling goes in bridging the gaps)

-   Modelling allows compress things across space

-   Assist experiments in general - “Computational Biology is the leader in telling us what experiments do” - David Eisenberg

-   Inexpensive

-   Generalization

Some biological problems that cannot be solved without computer:

-   Sequencing large genomes

-   Protein Folding

-   Protein Ligand Interaction

## Challenges in Modeling Biological System

-   "Heterogenity" So much inherent noise and differences even between identical cells!

-   Evolution

> "Remember that all models are wrong, question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful"

## Types of Graphs

ex:

-   Protein Networks - undirected

-   Gene Regulatory Networks - Directed
